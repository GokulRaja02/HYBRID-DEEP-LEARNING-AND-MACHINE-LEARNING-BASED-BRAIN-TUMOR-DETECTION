# HYBRID-DEEP-LEARNING-AND-MACHINE-LEARNING-BASED-BRAIN-TUMOR-DETECTION
This project presents a hybrid deep learning and machine learning framework for automated brain tumor detection using MRI images. It employs three pre-trained convolutional neural networks—VGG16, ResNet50, and MobileNetV2—to extract high-level, discriminative features from brain scans. These features are then combined through concatenation and classified using an ensemble of machine learning classifiers, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), utilizing a soft voting mechanism to improve classification robustness and accuracy. The system classifies MRI images into four categories: 1.Glioma 2.Meningioma 3.Pituitary tumor 4.No tumor. The model supports both single-image and batch predictions making it suitable for practical clinical deployment. The hybrid approach capitalizes on the powerful feature extraction of deep networks and the interpretability and speed of machine learning classifiers to deliver a highly accurate, efficient, and reliable brain tumor detection tool, assisting medical professionals in timely and accurate diagnosis.
